For this project, I created an interactive timeline of the Cooper Hewitt's (CH) poster collection. Using their API[1] which gives access to in depth information for every item in their collection and Python libraries such as requests, pandas, gender_ai, and more I created a dataset contain 959 posters and relevant information. After numerous iterations, I created an interactive temporal visualization using Vega, available at https://middaugh.github.io/visualizing-design/scatter.html.  This visualization allows users ‘stumble upon’ a poster in a way that the CH’s current search-based method does not, filling a need for better visual exploration. Through encoding variables such as creation date, poster color, and designer gender, this visualization also provides insight into how poster design has shifted throughout the years and ways in which the CH could improve the inclusivity of their collection habits.
